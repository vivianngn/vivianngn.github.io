<h2 id="description-of-project">Description of Project</h2>
<p>My goal for this project is to design a website/platform where people of all backgrounds and ages have the ability to learn how to play an instrument at any level without any cost, can view pre-recorded lessons with instrument-learning basics, can schedule live lessons with a teacher they can match with, and have unlimited access to a high quality, large database of sheet music for any instrument.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-high-fidelity-prototyping">Purpose of High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
<p>The purpose of making a high-fidelity design is to test the functionality and accessibility of the final design you have created, that would be close to the final product. Additionally, it gives developers a clear vision of what the website or application would look like. You can also visualize the clear journey a user may take, and see whether or not the flow is ideal.</p>
<h3 id="design-process">Design Process</h3>
<p>I used my paper prototype as a reference to create this design. I utilized Figma to first create the design system (view <a href="https://github.com/vivianngn/DH110-VivianNguyen/blob/main/Assignment-06/Interface-Design-System.md">here</a>), and then incorporate it with all of the tasks I have proposed. With the feedback I received from the cognitive walkthrough we did in class with two other students, as well as my impression testing and feedback from the <a href="https://github.com/vivianngn/DH110-VivianNguyen/blob/main/Assignment-05/Low-Fidelity-Prototype.md">low-fidelity prototype</a> user testing, I was able to create my final designs.</p>
<h3 id="main-tasks-my-prototype-supports">Main Tasks My Prototype Supports</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Signing up + Onboarding</strong></li>
<li>Viewing and searching through a <strong>sheet music database</strong>, <strong>markup</strong> of sheet music</li>
<li><strong>Teacher search</strong> and <strong>booking lessons through a modal pop-up</strong></li>
<li>Searching through the Academy with <strong>courses</strong> that include <strong>pre-recorded lessons</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, my prototype supports:</p>
<ol>
<li>Viewing the <strong>homepage</strong> signed in/signed out</li>
<li><strong>Signing in</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The wireflows can be viewed in the Figma file in the “Wireflows” page. I separated the wireflows into each task so that it is easier to take in. I excluded showing the searching capabilities of the search bars, but they are clickable in the interactive prototype. Additionally, I have the arrows in lower opacity to indicate a flow going back for readability.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-walkthrough">Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Data from the cognitive walkthrough can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H3q55_8U40vloayw0qPKjkEpx3HTx40eNHog0cf7Mmg/edit" target="_blank" class="link-2">here</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the cognitive walkthrough went well. There weren’t many issues when my testers went through my prototype. I think one issue was that my testers could not find any issues, or at least did not mention any issues. Since that was the case, most of my iterations came from the feedback I received from the low-fidelity prototype testing, which will be in the next section. Next time I conduct a cognitive walkthrough, I think I would ask more questions specific to my design that would lead to more constructive criticism and feedback.</p>
<p>From the cognitive walkthrough, I found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>My testers understood the purpose of my website.</li>
<li>Both of my testers believed that “in terms of navigating the website, the breadcrumb indicates the progress well.” They liked the breadcrumb feature I added to the website.</li>
<li>My testers think that the clickable buttons were clear.</li>
<li>One of my testers stated that the “Home page is really colorful, inviting, and well done. Instantly get the impression that its a well-made credible resource.”</li>
</ol>
<p>From realizing that a breadcrumb makes it easy for a user to go back and visually show their progress in the website, I decided to add a breadcrumb for every feature, like below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69706820/170431144-222d29f2-e1f9-4288-80bd-8965973cd488.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Additionally, since I learned that seeing progress is important, I decided to add a progress bar for the onboarding screens and the scheduling lesson modal screens, like below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69706820/170431174-8ae4d7d4-056c-42af-9c48-bea229d2c737.png" alt="image"></p>
