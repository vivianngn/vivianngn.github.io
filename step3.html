      <br />
      <h2 id="introduction-">Introduction üëãüèª</h2>
      <p>After conducting heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I realized that I needed to know more about the behavior, background, and user experiences of my target audience.</p>
      <h2 id="step-1-specify-the-design-challenge-">Step 1. Specify the design challenge üí≠</h2>
      <p><strong>What is the main activity your project would support for the users?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Musical instrument learning</strong> with teachers potential students can connect with, with features related to pairing students and teachers and scheduling lessons (can be virtual and in-person). There would be prerecorded lessons (like Khan Academy) as well that are open for everyone without the need for interaction.</li>
         <li><strong>Song learning</strong> with a database of accessible sheet music for any instrument. It would be interactive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>The basic need these activities fulfill includes the <strong>desire to learn and hone their skills</strong> in music. My project hopes to make people of all backgrounds feel like they can learn music without any barriers, whether it is resources or money.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Most instrument learners would find a music instructor through advertisements or mutual friends, although the selection is always limited, and older users might feel too embarrassed to ask around. Some users look up YouTube tutorials on how to learn an instrument. Currently, many people don‚Äôt really consider the option of taking virtual musical instrument lessons. There are also not many resources on the internet that provide information on a wider scope of music learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Limitations on looking for a perfect fit <strong>music teacher</strong> would be improved, as you would be exposed to a list that would fit your needs.<strong>.</strong></li>
         <li>Limitations on <strong>sheet music accessibility</strong> would be improved through my proposed project idea, as currently, a lot of sheet music is paid.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="step-2-target-users-">Step 2. Target users üë§</h2>
      <p><strong>What are the characteristics of users?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Demographics: My project would ideally be fit for people of all ages and backgrounds (e.g. kids, young-adults, adults, elderly, disadvantaged).</li>
         <li>Preferences: Users would be interested in the idea of taking advantage of the internet to learn music.</li>
         <li>Expertise: People of all levels of expertise are welcome. Those finding sheet music would probably have knowledge of musical instruments, and those looking for prerecorded lessons are likely to have no expertise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>In which context would the users do that activity?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Users would probably learn music within the vicinity of their own home, or institution, where instruments are located. Sometimes, a mobile device can be used to read sheet music, but mostly, it is through sheets of paper. Instrument learning through online methods would be more device usage heavy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>When learning a musical instrument, users would typically have an instructor by their side. However, due to COVID, it is becoming much more common to have online lessons. If that is the case, then a device would be used to connect the material with the user.</li>
         <li>When learning a new song through sheet music, the sources can include online sources, printed paper, or a paper book.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="step-3-research-methods-">Step 3. Research Methods üß™</h2>
      <p>I decided to use <strong>interview, participatory interaction</strong> of the user and <strong>observation</strong> as my primary research methods.</p>
      <p>For the interview and observation session, I followed a script that had the following structure:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Background questions</li>
         <li>Observing user‚Äôs music learning activities</li>
         <li>Follow-up questions</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>I had my subject perform three activities:</strong></p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <th>Activity 1 (general)</th>
               <th>Activity 2 (music learning)</th>
               <th>Activity 3 (music learning)</th>
            </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td>A general activity with a desire to work on a skill</td>
               <td>Learning/brushing up on an instrument</td>
               <td>Learning a song on an instrument of choice</td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The first activity was conducted on the subject‚Äôs phone. The second and third activities were conducted in the subject‚Äôs own home, by a piano, with a phone in hand. I used Zoom to record the audio of the interview and the laptop camera to observe. However, for privacy reasons, the video of the session will be kept confidential. Because of schedule conflicts, I was unable to come to their home in-person, so we opted for a remote Zoom call. Below is a picture of the home environment.</p><br />

      <h3 id="insights-">Insights üí°</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Having a forum (like Reddit) where people can share knowledge is helpful</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Sometimes, I think I would read on Reddit, I don‚Äôt know the specific group but they typically tell you how, when I had trouble finding my fingering on my own for a music, it would be like, I turn to Reddit, or like, the most like, optimal way to play a specific song, simply because I‚Äôd say, like, the chord progression is too big for your hand, and they‚Äôd tell you a more efficient or optimal way, if you have smaller hands, to play specific music.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> My subject mentioned forums and the use of Reddit a lot, which makes me think that the <strong>sharing of knowledge</strong> is really important when learning anything, and specifically musical instrument learning. I would like my final project to have a forum feature where communication is prevalent.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Would be helpful to have a feature to digitally write on sheet music, and an automatic scroll</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>(You brought up a good point about writing on your sheet music. When you‚Äôre learning your song earlier on Musescore, you were not able to particularly write on that sheet music, right? Do you think that would be a helpful thing?) I think that would be an extremely helpful thing to have when you‚Äôre learning your songs. Yes. Just so like, you will probably forget when you‚Äôre playing through the song again. And it‚Äôll take longer for you to really integrate that into your memory.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> He mentioned that Musescore is frustrating to use when viewing music on your phone because you would have to scroll for yourself and it messes with the rhythm and learning process. These are features he would like to see when using a sheet music viewing app digitally on a smaller device.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Not all people have connections to teachers and easy access to materials</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>I came across my piano teacher through connections, and I think that often times people don‚Äôt have that same connection with people, so I think what I had was pretty rare. As it is not someone who posts themselves online. It‚Äôs just like, you know this person and you keep referring people to that said person... Yes. I think that my piano teacher provided me with a lot of things that I did not have to think about myself, and I think that was pretty nice.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> He mentioned that most of his piano education was provided by his piano teacher that was found through connections. I want to focus on providing an equal amount of support for the users of my project that could be found from a personal teacher.</p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="step-6-reflection-and-documentation-">Step 6. Reflection and Documentation ‚úçüèª</h2>
      <p>The interview went well and lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes. My subject was definitely a part of my target audience and offered a lot of insight regarding music learning and the features that would enhance his experience with music learning. I especially learned a lot of insight about Musescore and some features he would change on the website. However, the biggest problem was having the interview and observation go smoothly, as we Zoom called instead of having me visit his place in person. His laptop died in the middle of the participatory observation, which was a technical difficulty I did not foresee happening, which would have interrupted the flow of things. Additionally, my roommate was being inconsiderate and was speaking loudly on the phone in the background, and I did not have the heart to say that I was recording an important meeting. Next time, I will make sure that the environment is quiet and without distractions. I would also try to have it in person, as the natural flow of a conversation and events would be better, and I would be able to see the subject&#39;s actions in real-time, in front of me.</p>
