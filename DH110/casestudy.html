        Musical-u <span style="font-family: Playfair Display">Case Study</span>
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Many older adults believe that mastering a new musical instrument has
        little reputation for adults. Similar to learning a foreign language,
        learning an instrument is commonly seen as something that must be
        embedded during the formative (younger) years, otherwise the learner
        will be hopelessly behind, if not simply hopeless. It is believed that
        learning becomes much harder past the developmental stage of growth, so
        many individuals feel disheartened to start learning. As a child, I took
        a year of piano lessons, yet it was too costly for me to continue,
        coming from a disadvantaged background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I am an adult, with desires to continue the piano education I
        once had, I want to help others who find themselves wanting to learn an
        instrument past their formative years, and especially those who come
        from impoverished backgrounds and cannot afford traditional music
        teaching.
      </p>
      <h2>Design Statement</h2>
      <p>
        With my own personal background concerning the inaccessibility of music,
        I found that I wanted to create a free-of-charge online music school
        (conceptually in the form of a non-profit), that includes a sheet music
        database, lesson booking and matching with a teacher, and pre-recorded
        lessons.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, my question is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
          How might we design a free, online music learning platform that serves
          people of all ages and backgrounds, accessible to those of underserved
          communities?
        </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted competitor analysis of similar websites, first through
        <strong>heuristic evaluation.</strong> Based on the 10
        heuristics/severity ratings from the
        <a
          href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/"
          class="link-2"
          >NN Group</a
        >, I evaluated two websites:
        <a href="https://www.lessonface.com/" class="link-2">Lessonface</a>, and
        <a href="https://bluebearmusic.org/" class="link-2">
          Blue Bear School of Music</a
        >
        to see how they were advertising and designing their services.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69706820/161950278-9d344d35-a78e-442c-bff0-48f4457500a2.png"
        alt="Lessonface"
      />
      <p>
        I chose Lessonface as a competitor application because this website
        displayed many features I envisioned to include. These include the
        feature to personally match with a suitable teacher, reviews, and
        individual pages for teachers with information. However, I would like to
        focus only on instrument learning, and emphasize more on the idea that
        everyone is welcome to learn instruments. I wanted to use Lessonface as
        inspiration and to help me decide what to build upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        From analyzing Lessonface, I found that I would like to add an
        onboarding feature and to have a less cluttered hero section.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose Blue Bear School of Music because it is a nonprofit, so the
        organization naturally has the same goal as me for my project idea.
        Although I don't foresee my project working with an actual nonprofit, I
        still think there are parallels between this organization and my
        proposed project. There is a lot of room for improvement for Blue Bear's
        website, design-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many design choices that could be improved. On the surface,
        there are many issues of color contrast, textual hierarchy, website
        organization, and button styles. From my research, I decided that my
        project will focus on having smarter design choices for accessibility.

      <h3>Pilot Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Following the heuristic evaluation, I wanted to learn more about the
        potential usability problems Lessonface might've had. I conducted
        usability testing using the heuristics and issues I highlighted from my
        heuristic evaluation and created tasks accordingly.

        Below is the UT session video on YouTube. I used Zoom to record the
        session between me an my participant on my PC, while my participant was
        sharing his screen through Zoom on his laptop.

      <p>
        Following the UT, I found that my participant experienced the issues I
        was testing. I was also introduced a new issue with the website's
        responsive design, where information was omitted when the window became
        smaller.

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        After conducting heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I realized
        that I needed to know more about the behavior, background, and user
        experiences of my target audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to use interview, participatory interaction of the user and
        observation as my primary research methods. I chose to talk to someone
        with a background in music and had a piano with learning resources
        nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I had my subject perform three activities in front of me:</strong

          <tr>
            <th>Activity 1 (general)</th>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>A general activity with a desire to work on a skill</td>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        My findings included that having a forum (like Reddit) where people can
        share knowledge, a feature to digitally write on sheet music + an
        automatic scroll would be helpful features to include. Additionally, I
        found through our conversation that not all people have connections to
        teachers and easy access to materials.

      <h2>UX Storytelling</h2>
      <h3>Persona + Usage Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        I decided on three features I would want to focus on for my personas,
        Diego and Nidhi.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Sheet music database</strong> that is accessible, high
          quality, and free
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teacher finding/search feature</strong> with a high level
          filter
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scheduling lessons feature</strong> with a calendar and
          confirmation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dfsmM69.png" alt="Persona 2" />
      <p>
        I created two personas with their own stories to tell. By writing Whys
        (Why are they using this product?) and Hows (How are they using this
        product?), I was able to insert myself into my potential users' shoes.

      <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        I first designed my features, wireframes, and prototype with pencil and
        paper. Using information gathered from prior research, I was able to
        start ideating my platform. After sketching out my prototype, I asked a
        participant to go through the prototype and mark their journey. I also
        acquired feedback on what to change or add for my high-fidelity
        prototype.

      <h2>Interface Design System</h2>
      <p>
        I used my paper prototype as a reference to create this design. First, I
        used Figma and created a frame with a custom size. I then laid out my
        components from the paper prototype. I then created the logo for my
        proposed service, Musical-u. I decided to go with a cool-toned color
        palette (purple/blue), avoiding warm tones like red, which is an
        alerting color, and yellow, which is difficult to design around because
        of contrast reasons. After coming up with the logo and color palette and
        checking its contrast ratios, I was able to come up with a fairly high
        quality design. Then, I made variations according to options I preferred
        for typography, shape, and light/dark mode.

      <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        After creating my low-fidelity prototype and finalizing my interface
        design system, I was ready to start designing my high-fidelity
        prototype, where I could visualize my fleshed out application. I
        utilized Figma to first create the design system, and then incorporate
        it with all of the tasks I have proposed by creating the remaining
        wireframes. Using the feedback I received from the cognitive walkthrough
        we did in class with two other students, as well as my impression
        testing and feedback from the low-fidelity prototype user testing, I was
        able to create my final designs.
      </p>
      <p>My prototype supports these main features:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Signing up + Onboarding</strong></li>
          <li>
            Viewing and searching through a
            <strong>sheet music database</strong>, <strong>markup</strong> of
            sheet music
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Teacher search</strong> and
            <strong>booking lessons through a modal pop-up</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Searching through the Academy with <strong>courses</strong> that
            include <strong>pre-recorded lessons</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Additionally, my prototype supports:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Viewing the <strong>homepage</strong> signed in/signed out</li>
          <li><strong>Signing in</strong></li>
