      <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
      <p>This course introduces the fields of UX research and design. It covers UX design methods, including ethnographic field research, persona-scenario development, information architecture, interface design, prototyping, and usability testing. Students will learn by hands-on practice in a human-centered process : how to understand users, how to design interface &amp; interaction for users, and how to evaluate and communicate user experience design with users.</p>
      <h2 id="course-objectives-learning-outcomes">Course Objectives &amp; Learning Outcomes</h2>
      <p>Upon completion of this course students will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Apply a human-centered-design process </li>
      <li>Evaluate a user experience design and elaborate related theory and principles in the context</li>
      <li>Conduct user research in qualitative methods</li>
      <li>Conduct usability evaluation in quantitative methods</li>
      <li>Create user-friendly, easy to use, and accessible (WCAG 2 AA) graphical user interface design </li>
      <li>Develop interactive prototypes
      Document the design decision-making process</li>
      <li>Present the creative user experience design</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What I Learned + Takeaways</h2>
    <p>Throughout the process, starting from competitor analysis to designing my high-fidelity prototype, I learned a lot about UX design and research. The extensive research that was put into this project every week made me realize how in-depth this process could be. User interface design was in actuality, very much more research focused than design focused. The amount of testing and iteration that was done during this 9-week process was much more than I expected, so this class was really fulfilling.</p>
      <p>I was able to fulfill my goal of creating an entirely new application and designing all of the features I initially wanted to design. I also received a lot of feedback from testing participants.</p>
      <p>It was my first time going through heuristic evaluation, and I felt that I learned a lot about how I should go about competitor analysis. I was able to find a lot of issues with similar platforms that I would like to avoid. Then, it was my first time conducting a field study and contextual inquiry. Unfortunately, I did it through Zoom this time around, but in the future, I would like to visit the participantâ€™s place in person. It was also my first time drawing a low-fidelity prototype, and completely dismissed options to go back, simply because I initially believed that a browser back button would suffice. I decided to add breadcrumbs and easy ways to go back to my high-fidelity designs. Lastly, it was my first time conducting a cognitive walkthrough and learned a lot about how I can do testing that is shorter in length. Overall, my project turned out well and the research and insight I put into it really shows in the final product.</p>
